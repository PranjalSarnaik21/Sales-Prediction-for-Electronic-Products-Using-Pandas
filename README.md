2. You also need to have the Pandas library installed. If you haven't installed it yet, you can refer to the [official Pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/install.html) for installation instructions.


## Data Cleaning
- **Drop NaN values**: Remove rows with missing values using the `dropna()` method.
- **Change column types**:
- Convert columns to numeric type using `pd.to_numeric()`.
- Convert columns to datetime type using `pd.to_datetime()`.

## Data Exploration

6. **Top-Selling Product**: Identify the product that sold the most and analyze potential reasons for its high sales.

## Business Questions
1. What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
2. What city sold the most product?
3. What time should we display advertisements to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
4. What products are most often sold together?
5. What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?

## Conclusion
